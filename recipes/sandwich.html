            <hr>
            <p>Chutney sandwich in India is the equivalent of the America PB & J. It's the unassuming tea-time staple, the quick finger sandwich you slap together and offer to unannounced guests along with a pipping hot cup of chai. It's the sandwich of choice for road trips, breakfast, school lunch boxes and a quick after-work street snack before your commute home. There isn't a person in India or who grew up there that i know of, that hasn't had or known some form of a green chutney sandwich </p>
            <p>It is essentially like a pesto ot of cilantro(coriander leaves) and mint in a staple condiment in a lot of homes. There are alot of different versions of green chutney and almost every house makes it differently. Anyway you make it .... it's yummy and great condiment to have your fridge not just for sandwiches. It's often eaten as a dipping sauce for samosa's, fried snacks, dosas, idlis, kebabs etc. or as a meal acocompaniment like pickle.</p>
            <p>A lot of times, a green chutney sandwich is made as simple as sliced soft white bread, salted butter and green chutney. That's it. It's grilled or fancied up. And always almost the crust is cut off. Sometimes, a layer of thin sliced cucumber is added for extra crunch. You don't need much else.</p>
